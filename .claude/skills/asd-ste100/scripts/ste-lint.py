"""Deterministic linter for the structural STE rules in SKILL.md.

Checks only rules verifiable without ASD's dictionary. Deliberately never
flags hedges or modality (may/might/could): the skill treats confidence as
content, and a linter that pressures hedges out would rewrite claims.

Usage:
    ste-lint.py FILE [FILE ...]
    echo "text" | ste-lint.py [--json]
    ste-lint.py --baseline 5 FILE      # pass unless hard violations exceed 5
    ste-lint.py --disable passive-voice,present-perfect FILE
    ste-lint.py --selftest

Exit 1 when hard ("advisory-free") violations exceed the baseline (default 0).
Advisory findings (passive voice, compound tenses) never fail the run.
